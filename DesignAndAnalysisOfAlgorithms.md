### Theme of Lecture:
- similar problems can have different complexity
- P: class of problems solvable in polynomial time O(n^k) for some constant k. 
    - Shortest-path: O(v^2), for v = verticies in graph
- NP: Non-deterministic polynomial time. Class of probs. solution is verifiable in polynomial time.
    - Hamiltonian cycle: given a directed graph, find a simple cycle that contain each vertex in V
- NP-complete: problem is in NP and is as hard as any problem in NP.
