# Understanding P vs NP

### Introduction
P vs NP concerns the question of how an algorithm used on a problem (P, polynomial time) that can find a solution, relates in some way to problems that, while hard for an algorithm to find an answer in P-time, can be quickly checked (NP, nondeterministic polynomial time)

#### P: Polynomial time
-size n problems, in polynomial times of n O(1).

#### NP: Nondeterministic polynomial time
-nondeterministic: can guess one out of polynomially many options in constant (O(1)) time.
-decision problems, resulting in YES or NO
-if guess leads to YES, then we get such a guess

Common thought: P =/= NP
