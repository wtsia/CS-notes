### Python
-interpreted, OO, efficient semantics
-Python developers, software engineers, back end developers, Python programmers
Used by employers in information technology, engineering, professional services and design
-Google, Pinterest, Instagram, YouTube, DropBox, NASA, ESRI

Python lets you work quickly to integrate systems as a scripting or glue language. Itâ€™s also suited for Rapid Application Develop (RAD).

The game Civilization 4 has all its inner logic, including AI, implemented in Python.
NASA uses Python in its Integrated Planning System as a standard scripting language.
Features:
Simple to learn and easily read
Associated web frameworks for developing web-based applications
Free interpreter and standard library available in source or binary on major platforms

### Java
-general purpose, OO, high level, good for web-based dev.

Who uses it?
Professions and Industries:
Software engineers, Java developers
Used by employers in communications, education, finance, health sciences, hospitality, retail and utilities
Major Organizations: V2COM, Eclipse Information Technologies, eBay, Eurotech
Specializations and Industries: Internet of Things (IoT), Enterprise Architecture, Cloud Computing

What makes learning it important?
Java is used to develop enterprise-level applications for video games and mobile apps, as well as to create web-based applications with JSP (Java Server Pages). When used online, Java allows applets to be downloaded and used through a browser, which can then perform a function not normally available.

Programs that use or are written in Java include Adobe Creative Suite, Eclipse, Lotus Notes, Minecraft and OpenOffice.
Java is the core foundation for developing Android apps.
Features:
Application portability
Robust and interpreted language
Extensive network library

### Ruby/Ruby on Rails
Ruby is an open-sourced, object-oriented scripting language that can be used independently or as part of the Ruby on Rails web framework.

Who uses it?
Professions and Industries:
Ruby on Rails developers, software engineers, data science engineers
Used by employers in technology, engineering, professional services, design, science and quality control
Major Organizations: Github, Scribd, Groupon, NASA Langley Research Center, Blue Sequence (part of Toyota Motor Manufacturing), Motorola, Google (SketchUp)
Specializations and Industries: Web App Development, Robotics, Networking, System Administration and Security
What makes learning it important?
Ruby is used for simulations, 3D modeling, and to manage and track information.

Basecamp, Amazon, Twitter and Groupon were all created using Ruby on Rails.
NASA uses Ruby to conduct simulations.
Features:
Free to use, copy, modify and distribute
Intuitive and flexible language
Completely object-oriented (ability to use method chaining)
