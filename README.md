## Languages Overview

### Python
-interpreted, OO, efficient semantics
-Python developers, software engineers, back end developers, Python programmers
Used by employers in information technology, engineering, professional services and design

Python lets you work quickly to integrate systems as a scripting or glue language. Itâ€™s also suited for Rapid Application Develop (RAD).

The game Civilization 4 has all its inner logic, including AI, implemented in Python.
NASA uses Python in its Integrated Planning System as a standard scripting language.
Features:
Simple to learn and easily read
Associated web frameworks for developing web-based applications

What makes learning it important?
Java is used to develop enterprise-level applications for video games and mobile apps, as well as to create web-based applications with JSP (Java Server Pages). When used online, Java allows applets to be downloaded and used through a browser, which can then perform a function not normally available.

Programs that use or are written in Java include Adobe Creative Suite, Eclipse, Lotus Notes, Minecraft and OpenOffice.
Java is the core foundation for developing Android apps.
Features:
Application portability
Robust and interpreted language
Extensive network library
