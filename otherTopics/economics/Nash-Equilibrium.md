# Nash Equilibrium

A strategy profile is a set of strategies, one for each player. Informally, a strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium if no player can do better by unilaterally changing his strategy. To see what this means, imagine that each player is told the strategies of the others. Suppose then that each player asks himself: "Knowing the strategies of the other players, and treating the strategies of the other players as set in stone, can I benefit by changing my strategy?"

If any player could answer "Yes", then that set of strategies is not a Nash equilibrium. But if every player prefers not to switch (or is indifferent between switching and not) then the strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium. Thus, each strategy in a Nash equilibrium is a best response to the other players' strategies in that equilibrium.

Formally, let <img src="http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=%7B%5Cdisplaystyle%20S_%7Bi%7D%7D&bc=Black&fc=White&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=modern&edit=0" align="center" border="0" alt="{\displaystyle S_{i}}" width="18" height="17" /> be the set of all possible strategies for player {\displaystyle i}i, where {\displaystyle i=1,\ldots ,N}{\displaystyle i=1,\ldots ,N}. Let {\displaystyle s^{*}=(s_{i}^{*},s_{-i}^{*})}{\displaystyle s^{*}=(s_{i}^{*},s_{-i}^{*})} be a strategy profile, a set consisting of one strategy for each player, where {\displaystyle s_{-i}^{*}}{\displaystyle s_{-i}^{*}} denotes the {\displaystyle N-1}N-1 strategies of all the players except {\displaystyle i}i. Let {\displaystyle u_{i}(s_{i},s_{-i}^{*})}{\displaystyle u_{i}(s_{i},s_{-i}^{*})} be player i's payoff as a function of the strategies. The strategy profile {\displaystyle s^{*}}s^{*} is a Nash equilibrium if

{\displaystyle u_{i}(s_{i}^{*},s_{-i}^{*})\geq u_{i}(s_{i},s_{-i}^{*})\;\;{\rm {for\;all}}\;\;s_{i}\in S_{i}}{\displaystyle u_{i}(s_{i}^{*},s_{-i}^{*})\geq u_{i}(s_{i},s_{-i}^{*})\;\;{\rm {for\;all}}\;\;s_{i}\in S_{i}}
A game can have more than one Nash equilibrium. Even if the equilibrium is unique, it might be weak: a player might be indifferent among several strategies given the other players' choices. It is unique and called a strict Nash equilibrium if the inequality is strict so one strategy is the unique best response:

{\displaystyle u_{i}(s_{i}^{*},s_{-i}^{*})>u_{i}(s_{i},s_{-i}^{*})\;\;{\rm {for\;all}}\;\;s_{i}\in S_{i},s_{i}\neq s_{i}^{*}}{\displaystyle u_{i}(s_{i}^{*},s_{-i}^{*})>u_{i}(s_{i},s_{-i}^{*})\;\;{\rm {for\;all}}\;\;s_{i}\in S_{i},s_{i}\neq s_{i}^{*}}
Note that the strategy set {\displaystyle S_{i}}S_{i} can be different for different players, and its elements can be a variety of mathematical objects. Most simply, a player might choose between two strategies, e.g. {\displaystyle S_{i}=\{{\text{Yes}},{\text{No}}\}.}{\displaystyle S_{i}=\{{\text{Yes}},{\text{No}}\}.} Or, the strategy set might be a finite set of conditional strategies responding to other players, e.g. {\displaystyle S_{i}=\{{\text{Yes}}|p={\text{Low}},{\text{No}}|p={\text{High}}\}.}{\displaystyle S_{i}=\{{\text{Yes}}|p={\text{Low}},{\text{No}}|p={\text{High}}\}.} Or, it might be an infinite set, a continuum or unbounded, e.g. {\displaystyle S_{i}=\{{\text{Price}}\}}{\displaystyle S_{i}=\{{\text{Price}}\}} such that {\displaystyle {\text{Price}}}{\displaystyle {\text{Price}}} is a non-negative real number. Nash's existence proofs assume a finite strategy set, but the concept of Nash equilibrium does not require it.

The Nash equilibrium may sometimes appear non-rational in a third-person perspective. This is because a Nash equilibrium is not necessarily Pareto optimal.

Nash equilibrium may also have non-rational consequences in sequential games because players may "threaten" each other with threats they would not actually carry out. For such games the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium may be more meaningful as a tool of analysis.
